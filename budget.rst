==================
 Budget estimates
==================

This chapter provides budget estimates based on the experience from previous
years and from the local organizers.

We have included the main income that comes from the registration fees. We are
looking actively for sponsors to cover the basic expense for the conference
(venue and catering).

Some sponsoring is received as direct support of the travel expenses to keynote
speakers which simplifies our accounting.

Venue
=====

The conference will take place at the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), on
the campus Solbosch. The rooms for the conference are provided at the cost for
members of the university as two organizers are part of the ULB.

Cost information for ULB lecture rooms
--------------------------------------

The Dupréel room is available for 200 euros a week day and 550 euros a day
during the week-end. Other rooms are available at no cost during week days.

Tutorials
---------

Costs

* No cost for H.1301 and H.1302.

Main Conference track
---------------------

The rooms for the main conference track is the Dupréel room.

* Total cost for saturday and sunday: 1100 euros.

Satellite meetings
------------------

The rooms for the satellite meetings are

* 200 euros for the Dupréel room.
* No cost for H.1301.

Global cost for the venue
-------------------------

The total cost for the venue is 1300 euros.

Catering
========

Catering for lunches and coffee breaks is provided. On the basis of previous
editions, we plan about 30 euros per participant per day for lunches.

Local costs
===========

A reasonable amount will be dedicated to small equipment, such as electric
plugs. Those are important to provide as many participants will bring and use a
laptop during the tutorials.

Support of invited speakers
===========================

We encourage the support of invited speakers directly by sponsors. This allows
us to ease the administration of the conference. At this time, we expect that we
may need to pay for one speaker, so an amount of 2000 euros is included in the
budget.

Support of other speakers
=========================

The conference builds up on an equal participation: everyone pays the
registration fees and supports its own travel. However, we understand that for
some speakers it is not possible (PhD students, ...). So, we plan to support
travel expenses for a few of them.

Revenue from registration fees
==============================

We consider two scenarios, one with a low attendance (L) and one with a high
attendance (H). The registration income and the catering costs are impacted by
this number.

Tutorials
---------

L
^^^

About 130 academic participants: 130 * 50 euros = 6500 euros

About 20 corporate participants: 20 * 100 euros = 2000 euros

H
^^^

About 170 academic participants: 170 * 50 euros = 8500 euros

About 30 corporate participants: 30 * 100 euros = 3000 euros


Main track
----------

We make the same estimates as for the tutorials.
