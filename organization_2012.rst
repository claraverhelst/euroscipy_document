Rooms
=====

All rooms require

* A video projector.
* Sound amplification.
* Possibly power outlets along the desks to connect the laptops of participants.

Tutorials
---------

The tutorials are held on days 1 and 2 (for 2012, thursday 23rd Aug. and friday,
24th Aug.) in two rooms that can hold more at least 120 people. The lectures
require

The tutorials consist of two parallel tracks of two days, held in two rooms

* 1 room for the "beginner" track.
* 1 room for the "advanced" track.

Main Conference track
---------------------

The main conference track takes place on days 3 and 4 (for 2012, saturday 25th
Aug. and sunday 26th Aug.). The capacity of the room should be of more about 250
people.

It consists of a single track on the two days, each day beginning by a keynote
talk. Then, there is room for contributed talks and a poster session. The talks
are selected by the program committee and last 30 minutes.

Satellites meetings
-------------------

Satellite meetings are held the day following the main conference track. In
2011, satellite meetings have been held on Physics and Neuroscience. The
attendance is expected to be lower than for the other parts of the conference,
with 50-100 participants per meeting.

Sprints
-------

Sprints are events allowing participants to collaborative projects to work in
the same physical location. The sprints require 3-4 rooms for 10 to 30 people
for collaborative work around tables, with video projector and amplification and
possibly power outlets along the desks to connect laptops.

Sprints begin on day 5, right after the scientific track.

* Day 5: Monday 27th Aug. 2012.
* Day 6: Tuesday 28th Aug. 2012.

Two seminar rooms are booked for the sprints in the K building.

Catering
========

During the conference, lunches and coffee breaks are provided.

Lunch
-----

For lunch, we plan a buffet with "mange-debout" tables.

Coffee breaks
-------------

Coffee breaks are provided: one in the morning and one in the afternoon.

Registration
============

Registration of participants will be taken care of by Logilab. Logilab manages
the http://www.euroscipy.org/ website. A online payment system is available.
This system has already been used in 2011 and Nicolas Chauvat of Logilab agrees
to take care of it for 2012.

Program management
==================

The program is managed, for the tutorials, main track and satellites, by their
respective program chairs. The program for the satellites is left fully to
satelitte organizers.

Sponsoring
==========

The overall budget for EuroSciPy is reasonable for an event of this
size. However, sponsoring is essential to ensure that good conditions are
provided to the participants.

Sponsoring takes place in different manners according to the sponsors.

Public sponsors
---------------

Applications have been filed within the university, to the "Fonds de la
Recherche Scienfique - FNRS" (Belgium) and "Visit Brussels", a local bureau of
tourism.

All of those sponsors replied positively to our applications.

Private partners
----------------

Logilab, based in Paris (France), supports the conference by hosting and
managing the website of the conference. The website is used to manage
registration, payment, abstract submission, reviewing and program
publication. This support from Logilab, especially with respect to online
payment, represents an important amount of work done for the conference.

Enthought Europe, based in Cambridge (UK), the managing director of which is
co-chairing the conference, confirmed early on their support to the
conference. This has played a key role in the good planning of the conference.

Private sponsors
----------------

EuroSciPy benefits from the support of the following private sponsors:

* NumFOCUS
* Continuum Analytics
* IBM Belgium
* Wingware
* Python Academy
* Github
