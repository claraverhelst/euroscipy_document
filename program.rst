==================
Scientific Program
==================

The two days of the scientific track of the conference start by a keynote
talk that provide a vision and/or a report status on issues of general interest
to the Scientific Python community. The rest of the day is devoted to
contributed talks that present the state-of-the-art in many fields of scientific
computing with Python.

The tutorials play an important role in the EuroSciPy conference and allow
beginner or advanced users of the Scientific Python tools to learn from
recognized experts. The first two days of the conference are devoted to the
tutorials that are held in two parallel tracks.

The keynotes speakers for 2012 are David Beazley and Eric Jones. The call for
contributions brought about fifty replies that the program committee selects for
talks. The topics range from collaborative projects such as scikit-learn and
scikits-image to field-specific developments and technical aspects of Python
computing. In addition to the talks, a dedicated poster session takes place
during the conference.

David Beazley is an independent software developer, author, and trainer. He has
a large experience in scientific research and software development and holds a
Ph.D. in Computer Science. His professional experience includes the following
positions:

* Owner/Operator, Dabeaz LLC, Chicago, Illinois. 2008-present.
* Consultant (Software Engineering and Analysis). Chicago, Illinois. 2005 - 2007.
* Assistant Professor, Department of Computer Science, University of Chicago,
  Chicago, Illinois. July 1998 to 2005.
* Staff Research Assistant, Condensed Matter and Statistical Physics Group
  (T-11), Theoretical Physics Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los
  Alamos, New Mexico. June 1991 to September 1997.

David Beazley published 26 papers in refereed journals and in scientific
conferences proceedings. To this track record should be added the SWIG software,
technical books and presentations, and many more realizations.

Finally, let us mention that he was an invited speaker at PyCon 2011. PyCon is
the worldwide conference on the Python programming language.

Abstract : Rethinking Extension Programming
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In 1995, I started the Swig project to add scripting language interfaces to
computational physics software written in C.  At the time, the notion of using a
language like Python for high performance computing was a fairly radical notion.
In fact, an underlying (unstated) philosophy of Swig was that "real code" would
be written in C/C++ and that Python bindings would simply be an optional
add-on--something that could be easily discarded if desired.  Today, I'm not so
sure about this philosophy.  Python now has a rich collection of scientific
libraries and tools.  Not only that, projects such as PyPy are promising better
performance.  Thus, if I were starting over, perhaps I would be inclined to
write my scientific software purely in Python and to dispense with C extension
programming altogether.  In this talk, I'm going to explore this idea by
revisiting some of my old scientific software and seeing what happens when I
attempt to recode it purely in Python using existing tools.

Eric Jones is the CEO of Enthought, a leading scientific Python consulting and
training company. He holds a PhD in Electrical Engineering, on the subject of
electromagnetics and optimization. Enthought provides scientific and engineering
software services to the industry. In addition to those activities, Enthought
supports the open source scientific Python community via the SciPy project and
other tools such as Mayavi, a 3D visualization software written in Python and
the Traits graphical user interface library. Enthougth also supports scientific
Python activities such as the worldwide SciPy conference and is a sponsor of
EuroSciPy.

Eric Jones is one of the founders of the SciPy project. SciPy is an ambitious
software library that aims at providing a general computing toolset to the
Python programming language. In addition to NumPy and Matplotlib, SciPy provides
a set of functionality that plays a key role in making Python a well established
scientific computing language.

Abstract : Python in the industry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As a consultant for the industry, one is faced with many legacy solutions for
computing. Proposing Python as the basis for a software project may be
problematic in some places. This is mainly due to preconceived ideas about the
Python programming language and poor comparisons to some of its proprietary
competitors. This talk reviews the obstacles one faces when proposing Python in
the industry in the light of years of consulting experince. The main points that
one is faced with are the performance, scripting nature of the language and its
scalability for industrial solutions. Those critics can very often be addressed
in a satisfactory manner and this is in part due to the wealth of scientific
libraries available in Python. Those libraries, in combination with the general
purpose libraries (especially GUI, network programming, file handling, etc.)
provided with Python enable the building of complete software solutions for
science and research.

Tutorial sessions
=================

The tutorials are held in two tracks: beginner and advanced. The purpose of the
beginner track is to introduce scientists to the general scientific tools that
are available in Python so that the participants can start right away to work on
their own problems. The speakers in the advanced track are established experts
on the tools they cover. The tools covered are aimed at current users of Python
who wish to learn powerful tools that are either related to a given field
(statistics, for instance) or that are related to general scientific computing
skills (performance optimization, for instance).

Beginner track
--------------

* Stefan Van der Walt: Array manipulation with NumPy.
* Stefan Schwarzer: Introduction to Python for Scientists.
* Nicolas Rougier: Introduction to Matplotlib.
* Ralf Gommers: Introduction to Scientific Computing with Scipy.

Advanced track
--------------

* Gaël Varoquaux: Better numerics with SciPy.
* Didrik Pinte: Enaml is not a markup language.
* Francesc Alted: Beyond NumPy: Numexp, Blosc and CArray.
* Wes McKinney: Stats and Panda.
* Pietro Berkes: Advanced Numerical Testing.
* Ian Ozsvald: Parallel Computing.
* Mike Müller: NumPy + Cython
* David Cournapeau: Building with Bento.

Contributed talks, posters and lightning talks
==============================================

The conference gathered many replies after the call for contributions. Fifteen
abstracts were selected for oral presentations and thirty three for poster
presentations. The posters can be presented in one slide during the talk
session. On saturday, a dedicated poster session takes place with enough time
for the participants to discuss.

As it is customary in many computing conferences, an oral session is devoted to
lightning talks: participants register on site to present results, solutions or
ideas in a short time. This session is very much appreciated because of the
original contributions it brings and because of its lively character.
