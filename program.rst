==================
Scientific Program
==================

The two days of the scientific track of the conference start by a keynote
talk that provide a vision and/or a report status on issues of general interest
to the Scientific Python community. The rest of the day is devoted to
contributed talks that present the state-of-the-art in many fields of scientific
computing with Python.

Depending on the volume of the contributions, a poster session will also be
held.

The tutorial play an important role in the EuroSciPy conference and allow
beginner or advanced users of the Scientific Python tools to learn from
recognized experts.

One keynote speaker has already confirmed his participation: David Beazley. We
are currently looking for a second keynote speaker. The contributed talks are
the object of a currently open call for abstracts and the program for the
tutorials is currently well advanced.

CV 
^^^

David Beazley is an independent software developer, author, and trainer. He has
a large experience in scientific research and software development and holds a
Ph.D. in Computer Science. His professional experience includes the following
positions:

* Owner/Operator, Dabeaz LLC, Chicago, Illinois. 2008-present.
* Consultant (Software Engineering and Analysis). Chicago, Illinois. 2005 - 2007.
* Assistant Professor, Department of Computer Science, University of Chicago,
  Chicago, Illinois. July 1998 to 2005.
* Staff Research Assistant, Condensed Matter and Statistical Physics Group
  (T-11), Theoretical Physics Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los
  Alamos, New Mexico. June 1991 to September 1997.

David Beazley published 26 papers in refereed journals and in scientific
conferences proceedings. To this track record should be added the SWIG software,
technical books and presentations, and many more realizations.

Finally, let us mention that he was an invited speaker at PyCon 2011. PyCon is
the worldwide conference on the Python programming language.

Abstract : Rethinking Extension Programming
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In 1995, I started the Swig project to add scripting language interfaces to
computational physics software written in C.  At the time, the notion of using a
language like Python for high performance computing was a fairly radical notion.
In fact, an underlying (unstated) philosophy of Swig was that "real code" would
be written in C/C++ and that Python bindings would simply be an optional
add-on--something that could be easily discarded if desired.  Today, I'm not so
sure about this philosophy.  Python now has a rich collection of scientific
libraries and tools.  Not only that, projects such as PyPy are promising better
performance.  Thus, if I were starting over, perhaps I would be inclined to
write my scientific software purely in Python and to dispense with C extension
programming altogether.  In this talk, I'm going to explore this idea by
revisiting some of my old scientific software and seeing what happens when I
attempt to recode it purely in Python using existing tools.
